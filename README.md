## Project Overview

**Beauty and wellness salons** are an integral part of the industry, offering essential services to a wide range of clients. However, efficiently managing appointments, staff, and promotion poses common challenges in this sector. Our project aims to address these challenges by developing a **custom web application**.

## Project Context

As part of my second-year internship in computer engineering, our host company proposed this project with the intention of offering it to hair salons.

## Project Objectives

Our project encompasses several key objectives:

- **Appointment Management**: The application will allow clients to book appointments and select services online, based on the availability of hairdressers and time slots.

- **Staff Management**: Salon managers will be able to handle staff schedules, leaves, and access client information. Hairdressers can also access their schedules and client details.

- **Marketing and Promotion**: The application will include marketing features, such as showcasing photos of completed hairstyles, special promotions, and sharing content on social media to attract new clients.

- **Customer Data Management**: The application will store customer information, including hairstyle preferences, appointment history, and contact details, to personalize services.

## Architectures and Design

In this chapter, we delve into the technical aspects of the project. Our implementation revolves around a **microservices architecture**, emphasizing the separation of application functionalities into autonomous and deployable components.

## Backend and Frontend Technologies

The backend is built using **Spring Boot microservices architecture**, providing robustness and scalability, while the frontend is powered by **Angular**, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Key Components of the Architecture

1. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, managing their distribution to the appropriate microservices and providing features like authentication and load balancing.

2. **Config Server**: Centralizes configuration management for all microservices, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying maintenance.

3. **Discovery Server**: Manages service registration and discovery, facilitating communication between microservices and enhancing system scalability and flexibility.

4. **Microservice User**: Focuses on user data and operations, such as appointment scheduling, discovering new salon services and offers, and more.

5. **Microservice Admin**: Manages admin-related data and operations, including appointments, employees, services, and work schedules.

6. **OpenFeign Integration**: Simplifies communication between microservices through declarative REST calls, streamlining inter-service interactions.

7. **Zipkin Usage**: Incorporates Zipkin for distributed tracing, improving application observability by tracking request journeys through microservices and aiding in latency issue identification.

## Microservices Benefits

Our microservices architecture offers benefits like modularity, flexibility, ease of maintenance, and scalability. It effectively manages various application functionalities while promoting transparent communication between microservices. These components play a vital role in building a robust, scalable, and easily maintainable application.
